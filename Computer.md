# Programming a Computer
There are many options for working with a computer. Some I have already posted in Classroom.
- [Hour of code](https://hourofcode.com/us) Some of you have played with this before, but you can go back. the higher grade level activities tend to be text-based.
- [VexCodeVr](https://vr.vex.com/) This is a virtual robot tutorial. You can use blocks or text-based programming.
  
- [The Alice Project](https://www.alice.org/resources/alice-3-lessons/): This is the project that came out of Building Virtual Worlds. You will need a computer for this. 
- Code Combat: Use the link in the assignment in classroom for this one. There are two versions. Code Combat and Osaria.
