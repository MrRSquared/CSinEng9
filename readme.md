# CS in English 9

Welcome to Mr. Roth-Ritchie's Computer Science in English 9 page.

I created this outside of Google CLassroom because it would be easier for me to maintain. Let me know if you have any suggestions, questions or concerns.

In order to explore the section of Randy Pausch's book entitled Enabling The Dreams of Others, we are going to play around with computer science for the next two classes. There is still homework which is listed elsewhere in Google Classroom. As we work with computers in class, I ask you to finish this section independently.

Why Computer Science? There are a few reasons.
1) This is the vehicle Randy used to enable the dreams of others
2) Learning computer science teaches a form of reading and writing that a normal English curriculum does not. This will make you better readers and writers. Without furhter ado, here are your pathways.

First decide, do you want to work on the [computer](Computer.md), or with a [robot](ProgIRL.md)?

Then, spend some time learning how to use it working through the tutorials.

Finally, take a screenshot or video of what you created and attach it to the assignment in classroom.
