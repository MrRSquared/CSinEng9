# Programming In Real Life

We have access to many computing in real life options. Most are robots, but the Finch and the Maqueen use microbits. Those can work independently.

1) [Sphero](https://edu.sphero.com/cwists/preview/19371x): These are probably best driven from the iPads
   - Sphero+
   - R2 Units For these, please use some padding so they do not run into any obstacles
   - Sphero Ollie
2) [Finch](https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/makecode/): These tutorials should run on a Chromebook.
3) [Maqueen](https://github.com/MrRSquared/Oscats-Hackathon/tree/main/Robots/Non-FRC/Maqueen/Maqueen_Plus_Getting_Started_Tutorial_MakeCode-master): These should be able to be run from your Chromebook
4) [Zumo](https://github.com/MrRSquared/Oscats-Hackathon/tree/main/Robots/Non-FRC/Zumo) fighting robots. You will need a robotics computer for these bots.
5) [Romi](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/programming-romi.html): This is a miniature version of the robots we use in our competition (sometimes, we actually compete with these.) You will need a robotics computer for these bots.

Regardless which robot you choose, here are some challenges for you...

- Make a robot move
- Make it stop after a certain time (Dead Reckoning)
- Make it stop after a specific distance (using an encoder)
- Turn to reach a target angle.
- Use a line sensor
- Use a rangefinder

You can use [The Oscats Hackathon](https://github.com/MrRSquared/Oscats-Hackathon/blob/main/Robots/ReadMe.md) if you would like a levelled challenge.
