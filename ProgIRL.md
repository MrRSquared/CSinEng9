# Programming In Real Life

We have access to many computing in real life options. Most are robots, but the Finch and the Maqueen use microbits. Those can work independently.

1) [Sphero](https://edu.sphero.com/cwists/preview/19371x): These are probably best driven from the iPads
   - Sphero+
   - R2 Units For these, please use some padding so they do not run into any obstacles
   - Sphero Ollie
2) [Finch](https://www.birdbraintechnologies.com/finch/makecode/): These tutorials should run on a Chromebook.
3) [Maqueen](https://github.com/MrRSquared/Oscats-Hackathon/tree/main/Robots/Non-FRC/Maqueen/Maqueen_Plus_Getting_Started_Tutorial_MakeCode-master): These should be able to be run from your Chromebook
4) [Zumo](https://github.com/MrRSquared/Oscats-Hackathon/tree/main/Robots/Non-FRC/Zumo) fighting robots. You will need a robotics computer for these bots.
5) [Romi](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/programming-romi.html): This is a miniature version of the robots we use in our competition (sometimes, we actually compete with these.) You will need a robotics computer for these bots. 
The Romi has a few introductory options. 
- To begin with the Romi at home, first install the software (this does not work on most Chromebooks).
- [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) has directions.
   - You will need to download the WPILib software from [Github](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2022.4.1)
   - You can use the wifi dongle ![wifi dongle](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/208ad6ea-8f27-422e-9018-a1c5fcd99cd6.7644846f1bea4d1b4966186b2962a1c5.jpeg?odnHeight=768&odnWidth=768&odnBg=FFFFFF)
- Then begin programming in the WPILib suite (VSCode) 
- The [WPILib Docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/programming-romi.html) are a great place to begin
- Then, Take a look at [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihO-mw_4Qpo) from team 6814 Ellipse. [Here](https://github.com/SeanSun6814/FRC0ToAutonomous) is their Git too. It is helpful.
- If you would like to go deeper into Java Programming, you can look at this video series from the incredible [Team Spectrum Team 3847](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5g4nHV3FaY&t=115s), or
- Our own [WPILib Course](https://mythinkscape.com/register/3ACACEBE) that goes in depth into how to program the Romi. 

Regardless which robot you choose, here are some challenges for you...

- Make a robot move
- Make it stop after a certain time (Dead Reckoning)
- Make it stop after a specific distance (using an encoder)
- Turn to reach a target angle.
- Use a line sensor
- Use a rangefinder

You can use [The Oscats Hackathon](https://github.com/MrRSquared/Oscats-Hackathon/blob/main/Robots/ReadMe.md) if you would like a levelled challenge.
